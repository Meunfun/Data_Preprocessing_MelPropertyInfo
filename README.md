# Melbourne Property Data Preprocessing

This project focuses on preparing and combining multiple data sources (JSON, XML, TXT, SHP, and web scraping) to support building a linear model for predicting median house price. The data includes property characteristics, suburb-level demographics, transport access, and other relevant features. Key preprocessing steps aim to align feature scales and enhance linear relationships with the target variable.
